== Front End Banking System ==

To automate compilation, simply type "make" in this directory.

This will create system.exe in the bin directory.

An __IMPORTANT NOTE__ is that the program assumes you are located in this
current directory when you run it.
TO RUN THE SYSTEM: Navigate to this directory and type "./bin/system.exe"

Alternativly if you want to run from a different folder, 3 of the constants at 
the top of main.cpp will need to be changed.
These constants function to allow the program to find the account file and 
create transaction files in the appropriate directories.

== Testing ==

To automate testing of the system, type "make test" in this directory.

The first test pipes the input files into the system and produces the actual 
output of the program.

The second test performs diff on the expected output and the actual output of 
the system and reports the differences in /tests/output/diff/

The third test performs diff on the expected transaction files and the actual 
transaction files produced by the system. /tests/test-transactions/diff

== Other Notes ==

The spreadsheets contained in this release of the system show the results of 
each "batch" of testing.

NOTE: There was an issue with comparing the expected transaction files and the 
actual transaction files generated by the system. This is due to an oversight 
in the naming convention of the transaction files that we did not have time to 
fix.
Thus, the transaction files for the following test cases will NOT be correctly
reported by the diff command: Deposit, Paybill, Transfer, Withdrawal

== Release Note ==
You may notice code referencing a Java Front End. As part of the project we 
merged our backend with a front end from another group writen in Java. As
it was not my code and I have not asked their permision, I have not released
it. Thus any references to Java code can be ignored.
